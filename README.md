# Pygame-Astar-Pathfinder
My implementation of A* algorithm with pygame.

COMMANDS:

'S': If you press 's' while your cursor is over a square(node), that square becomes the starting node.

'G': It works the same way as 's', but it sets the goal node instead.

'P' = If you already set the starting node and the goal, it starts the algorithm.

'R' = Clears the path.

'C' = Clears the obstacles.

Mouse's left button: Creates obstacles.

Mouse's right button: Remove obstacles.
